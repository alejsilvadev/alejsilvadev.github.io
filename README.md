# Alejandro Silva Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio, built to showcase my work as a web developer. It highlights my core skills, past projects, and a bit about who I am.

## 🚀 About Me

I'm Alejandro Silva, a web developer specializing in WordPress, front-end development, and clean, modern UI builds. I work primarily with:

* JavaScript
* React
* HTML & CSS
* PHP

Outside of coding, I love soccer, music, and gaming—interests that inspire my creativity.

## 🎨 Portfolio Structure

This one-page site includes:

* **Hero Section** – My name, title, and a bold introduction.
* **About Section** – A quick overview of who I am and what I do.
* **Projects Section** – A few placeholder project cards (to be updated with real work).
* **Contact Section** – My contact information for anyone looking to get in touch.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Modern UI styling

## 📬 Contact

More updates coming soon as I add projects and refine the design.
